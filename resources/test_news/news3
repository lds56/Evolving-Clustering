{"Time":"2015-05-20 17:00:00","Text":"\"PHONE CASES ARE supposed to be fun, you know?\" Sonny Moore, the producer and DJ better known as Skrillex, baron of Bangarang, has thought about this before. \"I really like the really crazy phone cases that are out right now. You see the girl's case that looks like a Starbucks cup, or the Moschino Jeremy Scott french fries. I think that shit's really fun.\"\n\nWhen he started talking to Google about being the first partner in the company's new Edition line of cases for Android phones, Moore was bursting with designs. Google had come to him with a wacky idea: Create a small, limited collection of phone cases that were just a little smarter.\n\nThe Accessories team set about building a case that uses NFC to identify itself to your phone. It would know exactly which case you put on and when, and send you wallpapers and content to match. \"We did, like, 20 designs,\" Moore says. His favorite was \"like Windows 95—it was a super vaporware one.\" Eventually his team and Google's settled on three, around a single theme: space. The cases are cool and busy in a retro-futuristic way, and they all feel like Skrillex: loud, intense, and a little bit adorable. Every one is individually numbered, with a print of Moore's signature on the inside.\n\nIf you buy one (they're available in limited quantities and designed only for the Nexus 6, and cost $40 through the Google Store), you'll get more than just a smiling alien on your phone. You'll get an ever-changing wallpaper, composed of photos captured by a satellite. Moore and Google actually launched 13 different satellites into the stratosphere just for this cause, each spinning in the atmosphere for about five hours. \"Getting a satellite isn't that hard these days,\" Moore says. \"It's just on a balloon.\" At night, the wallpaper changes to a constellation map, displaying the stars above your exact location.\n\n\n\nThe case also opens up a pipeline of videos, photos, and more from Skrillex himself. There's a button on the back of each one, which can launch any app, website, or function you choose—or it can show you more Skrillex. And just by putting it on, you become part of an exclusive fan club. \"We're constantly making videos,\" Moore says, \"and taking photos, and making sounds. So much of it we put on websites, but a lot of it just kind of sits on my phone. So we'll be sending random treats to the case that no one else will get.\" He's releasing a new compilation soon, and it'll go to case owners first.\n\nIt's made for superfans who want to show their devotion. \"You'll see people who have their NPR bag, or something that identifies themselves as something they love,\" says Kari Clark, the senior product manager of Google Accessories. \"And there's this potential to have your phone identify what you really care about.\"\n\nGoogle hopes this is a model for other artists and creators—more Edition partners coming, though Clark won't say who. But it might also show case makers how to think a little bigger. In the age of modular and personalized gadgets, users want their tech to feel distinctly theirs. The look and feel of a case does part of the job, but when we use our phones, we see the screen and touch the icons. What if case makers, with a single NFC or low-power Bluetooth chip, could change our whole device at once? What if putting on a case was less like changing outfits on your phone, and more like changing its personality completely? All of this is possible, none of it is hard, and it could become a big deal to everyone—not just Skrillex fans.","label":"case"}
