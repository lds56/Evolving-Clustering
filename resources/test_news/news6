{"Time":"2015-05-21 02:53:00","Text":"Apple may not have had any new Watches, iPhones or iPads to roll out, but yesterday the company took the wraps off an updated MacBook Pro with Retina display and a new 27-inch iMac desktop with a Retina 5K display.\n\nWith the 15-inch MacBook Pro, Apple added a feature that had previously only been found on its 13-inch MacBook Pro models. The 15-inch model is available as of this week in two configurations, one priced at $1,999 and the second at $2,400. For those who want to customize their MacBook, Apple has a build-to-order option where several higher-end features can be added. The cost for any custom-built unit will vary, but is likely to be higher than the $2,400 version.\n\n\"We are thrilled to bring the new Force Touch trackpad, faster flash storage and longer battery life to the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display,\" said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.\n\nApple iMac\nApple's newest iMac has a 27-inch 5K display.\n\nForce Touch delivers haptic feedback, basically a sensation felt by the fingers when the trackpad is used. Apple described it as giving the user a uniform feel and lets the person customize the amount of pressure needed to register a click on the trackpad. Apple is even making an application program interface (API) available so third-party developers can devise new gestures that can be used on the trackpad.\n\nApple also improved upon the speed of the solid state drive (SSD) that the MacBook uses for storage boosting the data transfer speed by 2.5 times to 2GB per second.\n\nThe lower-priced MacBook Pro comes with a 2.2 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.4 GHz, 16GB of memory, a 256GB SSD and Intel Iris Pro graphics. The pricier model has a 2.5 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.7 GHz, 16GB of memory, a 512GB SSD and AMD's Radeon R9 M370X graphics.\n\nSome of the options that can be included with a build-to-order model can include a faster Core i7 quad-core processor and a 1TB SSD.\n\nThe new 27-inch iMac all-in-one computer comes with a Retina 5K display for $1,999. The screen resolution is 5120 x 2880 and Apple says that equates to 67 percent more pixels than a standard 4K display. It is powered by an Intel Core i5 processor, has discrete AMD Radeon R9 M290 graphics, 8GB of memory and 1TB of storage. The iMac's storage uses a traditional hard disk drive not SSD. There are also as four USB 3.0 ports and two Thunderbolt 2 ports.","label":"apple15"}
