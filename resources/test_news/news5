That's when a very interesting and important story is hidden under a somewhat less sensational, ho-hum headline. A buried lede is usually discovered as one scans disinterestedly through what seems like another boring press release, and when one finds it, one feels a jolt of excitement of getting much more than they bargained for.\n\nI have not buried the lede in this story. With that in mind, let's start with this headline from Android's official blog.\n\nThe limited-edition Skrillex Live Case: Built for fans. Made for Android.\n Skrillex Live Case\nOh cool, Skrillex made a Skrillex-themed Android phone case. I love you, Sonny, but so has Hot Topic, I'm pretty sure. I'll read a little more about this out of affection for you and all your creative journeys, but I'm probably not in the market for this.\n\nEnter Editions, a series of creative collaborations to develop limited-edition cases for Android phones. We are kicking off the series with Grammy-winning producer, Skrillex, who has created three unique designs inspired by his lifelong fascination with space. The Skrillex Live Case connects to your phone to bring you VIP access to Skrillex content and a companion live wallpaper that extends its design onto the screen.\nSKRILLEX'S LIFELONG FASCINATION WITH SPACE\n\nWait, this sounds like something a little more involved than just a case. Apparently, Skrillex made a custom .jpg file just for me, his no. 1 fan, to put on the home screen of the Android phone I don't have. How thoughtful of him!\n\nDo tell me more about Skrillex's lifelong fascination with space, though. I don't care much about this phone case/wallpaper combo, but I'd love to know more about things Skrillex likes.\n\nThe companion live wallpaper updates over the course of the day showing stunning images of Earth shot from the stratosphere. At night, it changes to display constellations visible from your current location.\nWhoa, that's actually ... pretty cool. It's like having the ISS live TV special on your phone! Too bad I don't have an Android phone, I might get this just for funsies.\n\nTo capture the Earth images, Google and Skrillex launched a custom-designed balloon satellite named after Skrillex's dog, Nanou.\nWait.\n\nWhat?\n\nGoogle launched a satellite specifically for Skrillex?\n\nAnd they named it after his dog?\n\nThere is an object in orbit around our planet right now named after Skrillex's dog?\n\n Skrillex Live Case\nTHIS IS THE BEST NEWS I'VE HEARD ALL DAY\n\nThis is the best news I've heard all day. This is probably the most important news I've heard all day. Once something is in orbit around Earth, it becomes the most important thing on the planet strictly via altitudinal hierarchy. And with most celebrities, I'd consider something like this to be a vain exercise in self-deification, but not with my buddy Skrillex. He deserves to have a Google satellite named after his dog. He deserves every success that ever comes to him.\n\nHere's a video of Skrillex explaining the creative journey that led to him designing an Android phone. Please watch and enjoy it. The Skrillex Live Case is available in limited quantities now on the Google Store, in three models for the Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung Galaxy S6, and Samsung Note 4.","label":"case"}
