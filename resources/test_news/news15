{"Time":"2015-05-21 10:27:00","Text":"Android may soon power your coffee maker, refrigerator, and a whole host of home devices that connect to the Internet.\n\nThe Information reports that Google is building an Android-powered operating system code-named Brillo that will run on low-powered devices with as little as 32 MB of RAM. Also, no screen would be required to run the software. By comparison, the typical Android smartphone has at least 512 MB of memory. \n\nThe report says the operating system is the work of Google's Android team, so it will carry some type of Android branding. It also could connect into Google's Nest thermostats, which have demonstrated the capability to connect to Android Wear and Google Now.\n\nWhy this matters: The Internet of Things refers to the next wave of smart, connected home appliances and hardware. Google is likely hoping to replicate the success of Android, which powers the majority of mobile devices, with the connected home. The report didn't indicate if we'll see an announcement of Brillo at Google I/O, but we'll keep an eye out for it.","label":"iot"}
