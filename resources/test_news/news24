{"Time":"2015-05-21 16:39:00","Text":"Get ready for some serious multitasking\n\nApple is reportedly working on a drastic redesign for the iPad, enlarging the screen to 12 inches and introducing a new split-screen mode that could display two apps at once.\n\nThe split-screen feature was reportedly developed to take advantage of the larger, 12-inch screens on two new iPads, codenamed \"J98\" and \"J99,\" sources within the company tell 9to5Mac.\n\nWhile Apple has not officially announced the super-sized iPads, the company is reportedly considering a debut of the split-screen feature at Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference this June. The feature will reportedly divide the screen down the middle or in thirds, enabling users to multitask across apps, so that they no longer have to toggle between a web browser or email. The splitscreen effect is similar to a feature offered on some Android-powered tablets.\n\nThe redesigns come amid a slump in iPad sales, as consumers shift purchases toward large screen smartphones, or \"phablets.\"\n\n","label":"apple12"}
