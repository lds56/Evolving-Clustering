The cases have built-in NFC chips that talk to your phone and unlock new features: \"live wallpaper\" that changes throughout the day and access to VIP content.\n\nThey cost $40 a pop, and are available for Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy Note 4.\n\nSkrillex Made Some Expensive, Pointless Phone Cases With Google\n\nPersonally, I would pay money to have no Skrillex on my phone, but I don't mind the overall concept here. I wish the enhancements were more futuristic. Frankly, a Mophie Juice Pack is more innovative than these cases, which are mostly a gimmick. I hear Skrillex has fans, though. I'm sure they'll appreciate this.","label":"case"}
