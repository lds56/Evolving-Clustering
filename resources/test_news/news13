Apple later updated iCloud's status page to reflect that all services were working normally. The service issue lasted about seven hours, starting at approximately 2:15 a.m. ET and ending around 9:30 a.m. ET, according to the service's status page.\n\nApple didn't provide details on what caused the disruption or how many people were affected. However, the company said in a 2013 earnings report that 320 million people use iCloud, which lets them back up and sync information stored on Apple devices via the company's cloud.\n\nOther affected services included Back to My Mac; Documents in the Cloud; Find My iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac; iCloud Drive; iCloud Keychain; iWork for iCloud beta; and Photos.\n\nCustomers' comments suggested that some iCloud services, particularly email, experienced a total outage, contradicting Apple's claims that the problem was only causing slower response times.\n\nOne user posted a tweet saying \"iCloud is not currently slow, it's off and down.\"\n\nOther people reported similar problems with the mail service in the iCloud support forum, saying they received an error message when they tried to log in to their accounts.\n\nApple didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.","label":"icloud"}
