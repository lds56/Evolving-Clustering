{"Time":"2015-05-21 17:11:00","Text":"Improved traffic data could make driving less of a nightmare this holiday weekend\n\nGoogle is rolling out some new improvements to Maps in time for the traffic-heavy Memorial Day weekend. Users will be able to get more details about traffic conditions after entering a route.\n\nFor example, Maps might inform you that you are approaching construction and give an estimate for how long you might be stuck in a traffic jam. If the route is all clear, Maps will tell you that too. The app already helped users find alternate routes when dealing with heavy traffic, but it will be clearer in explaining why an alternate route is faster and the kind of incident you'll be avoiding by following it.\n\nGoogle also revealed the top trending search terms from last year's Memorial Day weekend to give a sense of the most popular activities during the holiday. Beaches were unsurprisingly led the list of locations, followed by cemeteries and restaurants.","label":"map"}
