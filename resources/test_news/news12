{"Time":"2015-05-21 08:16:00","Text":"Contrary to popular belief, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) music services iTunes Radio and Beats Music are available only in certain countries. However, MacRumors has recently reported that Apple aims to change this scenario by launching its new music streaming service in different countries across the world.\n\nBeats Music is only available in the US, while iTunes Radio is only available in Australia and the US. iTunes Radio launched in 2013 and it was promised that the service would be available in other countries as well - which obviously didn't happen.\n\nNow, Billboard reports Apple is already in the midst of making deals in Russia with local record labels. Though Russian iTunes users have access to music, apps, movies, books, as well as iTunes Match, Apple wants to \"expand its digital rights to streaming services,\" as per MacRumors.\n\nThe Russian media vehicle did not state whether the contracts for the streaming service will cover both iTunes Radio and the new streaming service, but it is imminent that more countries will be added to the support for the new service.\n\nAlong with a major redesign of iTunes Radio and Beats Music, the company has hired individuals to help the service curate content according to the market that's going to use Radio. For instance, former BBC Radio DJ Zane Lowe and other radio producers have joined Apple's ranks.\n\n\nWhile the Radio service will be free, Beats Music will have a payment tier of $9.99 a month; with a free, limited-time trial period. Apple Music will also sport a SoundCloud-like social network for artists who want their work to be showcased on the service.\n\nUpdates for both services will debut at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June with a revamped music app that will be available in iOS 8.4.","label":"radio"}
