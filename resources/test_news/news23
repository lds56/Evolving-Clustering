{"Time":"2015-05-21 16:27:00","Text":"Apple appears ready to go big with the iPad as sales of the company's tablet continue to suffer.\n\nAccording to 9to5Mac, citing sources briefed on plans, the company is working on a 12-inch model of the iPad, including multiple key features such as the ability to view two apps simultaneously and support for multiple logins.\n\nThe larger iPads would reportedly arrive later this year, while support for dual apps could be revealed as early as next month's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.\n\nThis is not the first report to touch on the possibility of a larger iPad. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported suppliers were told to start production of an iPad with a 12.9-inch screen. Current models of the iPad Air, the latest model, feature a 9.7-inch screen.\n\nAlthough sales of Apple's iPhone continue to surge, the iPad has struggled in recent quarters. During the second quarter, Apple sold 12.6 million iPads, down 23% compared to the same time last year. It also missed analyst forecasts of 15 million.","label":"apple12"}
